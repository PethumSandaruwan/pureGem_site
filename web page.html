             <p> A ruby is a pinkish red to blood-red colored gemstone, a variety of the mineral corundum (aluminium oxide). Ruby is one of the most popular traditional jewelry gems and is very durable.The colour spectrum of Rubies found across the world varies from orange-red to purplish red. Colour is the most significant factor affecting a ruby’s value: Fine gems are a pure, vibrant red to slightly purplish red.
              </p>
              <p class="pi1">
                Most Sri Lankan Ruby varieties are of a pinkish red and display a tint of purple, caused by the presence of iron in addition to chromium oxide, which is unique to its Sri Lankan origin. Ruby deposits in Sri Lanka are not distinctively localized and are found in the same mine with other gemstones of the Corundum family while the stones of better quality have been often found within the Embilipitiya – Udawalawe area.

                Sapphire is a precious gemstone, a variety of the mineral corundum, consisting of aluminium oxide (α-Al2O3) with trace amounts of elements such as iron, titanium, chromium, vanadium, or magnesium.sapphires are also used in purely functional applications, such as infrared optical components, high-durability windows, wristwatch crystals and movement bearings, and very thin electronic wafers, which are used as the insulating substrates of special-purpose solid-state electronics such as integrated circuits and GaN-based blue LEDs.

                One of the most important gem Tourmalines found in Sri Lanka are mixtures of Dravite and Uvite. Often brown, yellowish-brown, reddish-brown, or nearly black in colour, these species contain traces of vanadium, chromium, or both. When present in the right concentrations, these impurities produce rich green hues similar to tsavorite garnet.
